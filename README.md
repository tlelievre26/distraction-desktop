Developed my Stephanie Zhan, Taylor Le Lievre, and Wilson Wong

Unit testing library: Jest
Integration testing library: Playwright


Installation and Setup:
(Refine this later)
You gotta install InfluxDB yourself
{Describe how to install influx, start it, set up the bucket name, etc}
{Maybe we can have bucket/org name as other settings options}

Once you start up, you need to get the API key from your local Influx instance and put that + the path you installed Influx into the settings field
